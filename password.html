      <p>The Kaprekar's Constant, named after the Indian mathematician <cite>D.R. Kaprekar</cite>, is a special number obtained by following a specific mathematical process.<br>
      
      The process to obtain Kaprekar's Constant is as follows:<br>
      1. Choose a four-digit number (ensuring that not all digits are the same).<br>
      2. Arrange the digits in ascending and descending order to form two new numbers.<br>
      3. Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.<br>
      4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the obtained result until you reach the constant 6174.<br>
      5. Once you reach the constant 6174, the process stops, and no matter what number you choose afterward, you will always obtain 6174 as the result.
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The uniqueness of Kaprekar's Constant is that, regardless of the initial four-digit number chosen, you will eventually reach 6174 after repeating the process a few times. It acts as an attractor or fixed point in the mathematical sense.
      
      Kaprekar's Constant is an intriguing concept in mathematics due to its predictable and fascinating behavior. It has been studied extensively, and various properties and curiosities related to it have been discovered.</p>
